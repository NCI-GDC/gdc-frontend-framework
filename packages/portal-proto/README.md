# Portal Prototype

This prototype is built with React v17, Next.js v11, and Tailwind CSS v2. It also makes use of Redux-Toolkit and TypeScript.

The minimum node version is currently set to v14 for LTS reasons. The actual minimum for Next.js is v12.

## Installation

Install from the root of this multi-workspace repository. Installing from the individual workspaces will introduce duplicate
dependencies, which will cause problems with React.

## Development

To start a dev server on port 3000, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
